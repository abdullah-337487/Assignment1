1. Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.

PROGRAM Sum:
//taking input1 from user
PRINT"Enter first number: ";
THEN READ number1;

//save it in variable num1
num1=number1;

//taking input1 from user
PRINT"Enter second number: "
THEN READ number2;

//save it in variable num1
num2=number2;
sum=num1+num2;
PRINT"The sum of two numbers is: " sum;
END

2. Write a program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 100.

PROGRAM PrintEvenNumbers:
B=1
WHILE(B<=100)
DO IF(B/2 gives no remainder)
     THEN PRINT B;
  END IF
     B=B+1;
END WHILE;
END

3. Write a function that checks if a given year is a leap year or not.

PROGRAM CheckLeapYear:
READ year;
IF(year/4 gives no remainder)
	THEN IF(year/100 gives no remainder)
		THEN IF(year/400 gives no remainder)
	            PRINT"It is Leap year";
		ELSE
    	            PRINT"It is not a Leap year";
		END IF 
	ELSE 
	    PRINT"It is Leap year";
	END IF
ELSE
    PRINT"It is not a Leap year";
END IF
END

4. Write a program that converts kilometers per hours to miles per hour. Hint: 1km = 0.621371

PROGRAM KphToMph:
//taking input from user to convert
PRINT"Enter speed in kilometers per hours: ";
THEN READ kph;
mph=kph*0.621371;
PRINT kph "=" mph;
END

5. Write a pseudocode to check whether a number is a buzz number or not. Hint: A number is said to be buzz if it is divisible by 7 or it ends with 7.

PROGRAM CheckBuzz:
READ A;
IF(A/7 gives no remainder)
   THEN PRINT"It is a buzz number";
	ELSE IF(A/10 gives remainder 7)
	  THEN PRINT"It is a buzz number";
ELSE
    PRINT"It is not a buzz number";
END IF;
END

6. Write a program that asks a user for number and prints the multiplication table of that number up to 10.

PROGRAM MultiplicationTable:
//taking input number from user
PRINT"Enter a number for multiplication table: ";
THEN READ number;
i=1;
WHILE(i<=10)
DO answer=number*i;
THEN PRINT number,"*",i,"=",answer;
i=i+1;
END WHILE;
END

//Using for loop
PROGRAM MultiplicationTable:
//taking input number from user
PRINT"Enter a number for multiplication table: ";
THEN READ number;
FOR i=1 to 10
answer= number*i;
THEN PRINT number, "*",i,"=",answer;
i++;
END FOR;
END

7. Write a program that computes the factorial of a number (n!).

PROGRAM Factorial:
//taking input number from user
PRINT"Enter a number to calculate factorial: ";
THEN READ number;
TOTAL=1;
//save the user input in num variable
num=number;
WHILE(num>=1)
DO total= total*num;
num=num-1;
END WHILE;
THEN PRINT num,"!=",total;
END

8. Write a function that checks whether a number is prime or not.

PROGRAM CheckPrime:
//taking input number from user
PRINT"Enter a number";
THEN READ number;
IsPrime=True;
IF(number/2 gives 0 remainder)
    THEN FOR(i=2 to (number)/2)
           IF(number/i gives 0 remainder)
               THEN IsPrime=False;
           ELSE
              THEN IsPrime=True;
           END IF;
    i++;
    END FOR;
IF(IsPrime==True)
THEN PRINT"It is Prime number";
ELSE
PRINT"It is not a Prime number";
END IF;
ELSE
    FOR(q=2 to (number-1)/2)
           IF(number/q gives 0 remainder)
               THEN IsPrime=False;
           ELSE
             THEN IsPrime=True;
           END IF;
    q++;
    END FOR;
IF(IsPrime==True)
THEN PRINT"It is Prime number";
ELSE
PRINT"It is not a Prime number";
END IF;
END IF;
END  

9. Write a program to check whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene triangle. 
- In a scalene triangle, all the sides of a triangle are of different length.
- In an isosceles triangle, two sides of a triangle are of the same measure.
- In an equilateral triangle, all the sides of a triangle are of equal length.

PROGRAM CheckTriangle:
READ Side1;
READ Side2;
READ Side3;
IF(Side1=Side2=Side3)
THEN PRINT"It is Equilateral Triangle";
ELSE IF(Side1=Side2 or Side2=Side3 or Side3=Side1)
THEN PRINT"It is Isosceles Triangle";
ELSE IF(Side1!=Side2!=Side3)
THEN PRINT"It is Scalene Triangle";
ELSE
Do Nothing;
END IF;
END

10. Print this pattern: (using multiple prints and then by loop)
*
**
***
****
*****

PROGRAM Pattern1:
//using multiple prints

PRINT"*";
THEN PRINT"**";
THEN PRINT"***";
THEN PRINT"****";
THEN PRINT"*****";

PROGRAM Pattern2:
//using loop

FOR i=1 to 5
 DO FOR j=1 to i
      THEN PRINT"*";
   j++;
   END FOR;
   THEN GOTO NEXT LINE;
i++;
END FOR;
END
